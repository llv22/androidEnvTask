You use a slingshot to shoot with apples. Be first to destroy the whole enemy
base, but be aware, the other side shoots back. This game has a balanced mix of
puzzle, strategy, patience and action.

This is for one or two players! You can play this against anyone who sits next
to you - or against yourself. You can also play against a computer controlled
opponent. More features, more fun and more levels will come soon.
